LD32
====

My failed attempt at the ludum dare game making competition #32.

It's basicly just a base engine for a software rendered platformer.

Only thing that's working is the level editor.

I gave up, mainly I suck at drawing pixel art, which is just too furstrating.

The sprites used as a test aren't mine.
